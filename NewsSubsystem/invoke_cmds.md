News Subsystem Test Commands (PowerShell Invoke-RestMethod)
This file provides PowerShell Invoke-RestMethod commands to test the standalone news subsystem for cryptocurrency news curation on Windows. The subsystem fetches raw Sonar API responses for specified topics. Commands assume the server is running locally on http://localhost:3000. Ensure SONAR_API_KEY is set in your .env file.
Prerequisites

Server Running: Start the server in the project directory (C:\dir):cd C:\dir
npm start


PowerShell: Use Windows PowerShell (pre-installed on Windows 10/11) or PowerShell Core.
.env: Ensure SONAR_API_KEY is set in C:\dir\.env:SONAR_API_KEY=your_sonar_api_key_here
PORT=3000



Running Commands

Open PowerShell:
Press Win + R, type powershell, and press Enter.


Navigate to the project directory:cd C:\dir


Ensure the server is running (check for [Server] News server running on port 3000 in another terminal).
Copy and paste each command below into PowerShell and press Enter.
View full responses by piping to ConvertTo-Json to avoid truncation:Invoke-RestMethod ... | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10



Health Check
Test the serverâ€™s health check endpoint.
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/health" -Method Get

Expected Response:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "News server is running"
}

News Queries
Test news curation with different interests and days. The interests field is optional (defaults to ["cryptocurrency market trends"]), and days is optional (defaults to 7). Interests must match the allowed list in sonarNewsService.js (e.g., DeFi, NFT, Blockchain).
Single Interest (DeFi, 7 days)
Fetch news for a single topic.
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["DeFi"], "days": 7}' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Expected Response (example):
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1747351425,
  "model": "sonar",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "{\"news_status\":\"Content Found\",\"articles\":[{\"title\":\"DeFi Lending Surges in 2025\",\"summary\":\"DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound have seen a 40% increase in TVL in the past week, driven by new yield farming opportunities.

    "total_tokens": 971,
    "search_context_size": "low"
  },
  "citations": ["https://example.com/defi-news"]
}

Multiple Interests (DeFi, NFT, 14 days)
Fetch news for multiple topics.
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["DeFi", "NFT"], "days": 14}' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Expected Response: Similar to above, with articles covering DeFi and NFT topics.
Default Interests (7 days)
Fetch news with the default topic (cryptocurrency market trends).
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"days": 7}' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Expected Response: Similar to above, with articles on cryptocurrency market trends.
Invalid Input Tests
Test error handling for invalid inputs.
Missing Interests and Days
Test with an empty body (expects error).
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{}'

Expected Response:
{
  "message": "Either interests or days must be provided.",
  "errorCode": "INVALID_INPUT"
}

Invalid Days (e.g., 31)
Test with an out-of-range days value.
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["DeFi"], "days": 31}'

Expected Response:
{
  "message": "Days must be between 1 and 30.",
  "errorCode": "INVALID_DAYS"
}

Invalid Interest
Test with an invalid interest not in ALLOWED_INTERESTS.
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["InvalidTopic"], "days": 7}'

Expected Response:
{
  "message": "Invalid interest: InvalidTopic. Must be one of Web3, Blockchain, DeFi, ...",
  "errorCode": "PROCESS_NEWS_ERROR"
}

Notes

API Key: Ensure SONAR_API_KEY is valid in .env. A 401 error indicates an invalid key.
Response Structure: Responses include id, object, created, model, choices, usage, citations. The choices[0].message.content field contains JSON with news_status, articles, reason, sources.
Case Sensitivity: Interests must match ALLOWED_INTERESTS exactly (case-sensitive, e.g., DeFi, not defi).
PowerShell Version: Works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (default on Windows 10/11) or PowerShell Core 7+.

Troubleshooting

Empty Message Content: If choices[0].message.content is empty, check server logs for [SonarNewsService] errors (e.g., [SonarNewsService] Attempt X failed). Verify SONAR_API_KEY and test another interest (e.g., Blockchain). Share logs with the full response.
Truncated Output: Pipe to ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10:Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["DeFi"], "days": 7}' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10


Server Not Running: Ensure npm start is running. Check logs for errors (e.g., missing SONAR_API_KEY).
Connection Issues: Verify port 3000 is open:netstat -an | findstr 3000


Invalid API Key: A 401 response indicates an invalid SONAR_API_KEY. Check .env.
Rate Limits: A 429 response means the rate limit is exceeded; wait and retry.
JSON Errors: If PowerShell throws JSON errors, try single quotes for -Body:Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["DeFi"], "days": 7}'


Verbose Output: Add -Verbose for detailed errors:Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/news" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"interests": ["DeFi"], "days": 7}' -Verbose
